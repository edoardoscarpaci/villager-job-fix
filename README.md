# Villager Commands Mod

A simple Fabric mod that adds two utility commands for villagers:

## Commands

### `/villagerChangeOffers <limit> <widht> <height> <depth>`
- Refreshes the trade offers of villagers.
- Only affects villagers that **have never been traded with**.

### `/villagerFindJob <limit> <radius>`
- Finds villagers without a profession.
- Links them to the **nearest valid workstation**.
- Assigns them the corresponding job.

---

This mod is mainly for testing, debugging, or tweaking villager behavior in-game.
